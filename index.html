<h1>Type 40 TARDIS</h1>
<p>The Type 40 TARDIS is the equivalent to a campervan. There aren't many Type 40s left. The Doctor stole his type 40 TARDIS from the TARDIS repair "Shed". When he first touched the console he said it was the most beautiful thing he'd  ever seen. It was also referred to as "vintage" or old. About 305 were grown on Gallifrey and offically registered with the Gallifreyan authities. </p>
    
<h1>Type 1 TARDIS</h1>
    <p>The type 1 TARDIS was poorly designed, dangerous to operate, and difficult to start. Some of them had minds of their own, with a history of escaping and roaming the universe. It was an early prototype created by the elders of ancient Gallifrey. </p>
